# This is the python main file.

# This is from feature1 branch;

# git branch -> to check branch;
# git branch feature1 -> to create branch;
# git checkout feature1 -> to switch to feature1
# created branch will copy the code of branch from where we are creating the branch;
# git checkout -b feature1
# this command will not work as feature1 is already created
# so, git checkout feature1 is enough to switch to the branch
# git checkout -b feature3 feature2
# Though I am on the main branch, but feature3 will not created 
# based on main, rather it will all code from feature2
# as we have explicitly mention feature2
